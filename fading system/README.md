# Screen fading system

TODO docs... sorry :(

It's a bit confusing, not even I know exactly how it works at this point... There's more than one way to use it, depending on whether you need a simple fade, or a trasition between game states. It's probably trying to do more than it should all at once. I'll have to really dive into it one of these days and see if I sort it out and do some proper documentation.

However, it does work, and quite nicely at that. I've made it specifically for a [WIP roguelike](https://github.com/Skaruts/Pigventure-or-something).
